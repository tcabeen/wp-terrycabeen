# wp-terrycabeen
A Wordpress child theme for [twentytwelve] (https://wordpress.org/themes/twentytwelve/) that I created for my [own site] (http://terry.cabeen.net) and gave the most logical and narcissistic name.

If you'd like, you can also see a [demo] (https://twentytwelvedemo.wordpress.com/) of twentytwelve in its current default state. It's lovely, but lacks individuality. A perfect blank slate.
